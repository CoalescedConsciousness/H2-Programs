### Current Version: 1.0.1

## Changelog:
# 1.0.1
- Additional polish to UI
- Finetuned turn-taking as well as dynamic changing of the number of players.
- Added betting functionality.

# 1.0.0
- Added logic for multiple players; hit, stand, cycling player turns.
- Added logic for Dealer: iterating through their turn automatically when appropriate.
- Added some settings (# of players)
  - "Cards" setting is WIP, for the moment being on the backburner, as it is nice-to-have rather than need-to-have.
- Added recursive game logic to ensure Aces use appropriate values.


# TO-DO:
- Add logic so Dealer doesn't HAVE to get to between 16 and 21; simply above player hand and below 21 should suffice.
[X] Add betting feature.
